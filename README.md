# Robotics Lab

This repository contains code developed for the SPADS100, a 4-DOF robotic arm. It includes key algorithms for forward/inverse kinematics, imitation learning, and path planning. The robot's configuration, such as joint limits and dimensions, can be easily adjusted in `Spad.py`.

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/A-H-Mansoury/robotics_lab.git
cd robotics_lab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run specific algorithms:
```bash
python3 ForwardKinematic.py  # Forward kinematics
python3 InverseKinematic.py  # Inverse kinematics
python3 ImitationLearning.py  # Imitation learning
```
